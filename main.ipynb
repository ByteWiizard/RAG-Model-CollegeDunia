Sparks may cause an explosion or fire resulting in injury or death. Note restrictions in areas with fuel; chemical plants; or where blasting operations are in progress. Areas with a potentially explosive environment may not be clearly marked. These usually are areas where you are advised to switch your engine off, below deck on boats, chemical transfer or storage facilities, and where the air contains chemicals or particles.

Refer to the following.European RF Exposure InformationYour mobile device is a radio transmitter and receiver. It is designed not to exceed the limits for exposure to radio waves recommended by international guidelines. These guidelines were developed by the independent scientific organization ICNIRP and include safety margins designed to assure the protection of all persons, regardless of age and health. The guidelines use a unit of measurement known as the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR. The SAR limit for mobile devices is 2.0 W/kg and the highest SAR value for this device when tested at the ear is 0.751 W/kg*. As mobile devices offer a range of functions, they can be used in other positions, such as on the body. In this case, the highest tested SAR value is 1.202 W/kg* at the separation distance of 0.5 cm from the body. For electronic safety, maintain the separation distance with accessories containing no metal, that position handset a minimum of the above distance. Use of other accessories may not ensure compliance with RF exposure guidelines.* The tests are carried out in accordance with international guidelines for testing.About Digital Rights ManagementWhen using this device, obey all laws and respect local customs, privacy and legitimate rights of others, including copyrights.

Refer to the following.European RF Exposure InformationYour mobile device is a radio transmitter and receiver. It is designed not to exceed the limits for exposure to radio waves recommended by international guidelines. These guidelines were developed by the independent scientific organization ICNIRP and include safety margins designed to assure the protection of all persons, regardless of age and health. The guidelines use a unit of measurement known as the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR. The SAR limit for mobile devices is 2.0 W/kg and the highest SAR value for this device when tested at the ear is 0.751 W/kg*. As mobile devices offer a range of functions, they can be used in other positions, such as on the body. In this case, the highest tested SAR value is 1.202 W/kg* at the separation distance of 0.5 cm from the body. For electronic safety, maintain the separation distance with accessories containing no metal, that position handset a minimum of the above distance. Use of other accessories may not ensure compliance with RF exposure guidelines.* The tests are carried out in accordance with international guidelines for testing.About Digital Rights ManagementWhen using this device, obey all laws and respect local customs, privacy and legitimate rights of others, including copyrights.

Refer to the following.European RF Exposure InformationYour mobile device is a radio transmitter and receiver. It is designed not to exceed the limits for exposure to radio waves recommended by international guidelines. These guidelines were developed by the independent scientific organization ICNIRP and include safety margins designed to assure the protection of all persons, regardless of age and health. The guidelines use a unit of measurement known as the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR. The SAR limit for mobile devices is 2.0 W/kg and the highest SAR value for this device when tested at the ear is 0.751 W/kg*. As mobile devices offer a range of functions, they can be used in other positions, such as on the body. In this case, the highest tested SAR value is 1.202 W/kg* at the separation distance of 0.5 cm from the body. For electronic safety, maintain the separation distance with accessories containing no metal, that position handset a minimum of the above distance. Use of other accessories may not ensure compliance with RF exposure guidelines.* The tests are carried out in accordance with international guidelines for testing.About Digital Rights ManagementWhen using this device, obey all laws and respect local customs, privacy and legitimate rights of others, including copyrights.

This may damage the battery or the other object.Small childrenYour device and its accessories are not toys. They may contain small parts. Keep them out of the reach of small children.Medical devicesOperation of radio transmitting equipment, including wireless phones, may interfere with inadequately shielded medical devices\\' function. Consult a physician or the medical device\\'s manufacturer to determine if it is adequately shielded from external radio energy.Implanted medical devicesTo avoid potential interference, manufacturers of implanted medical devices recommend a minimum separation of 15.3 centimeters (6 inches) between a wireless device and the medical device. Persons who have such devices should:•Always keep the wireless device more than 15.3 centimeters (6 inches) from the medical device.•Not carry the wireless device in a breast pocket.•Hold the wireless device to the ear opposite the medical device.•Switch the wireless device off if there is any reason to suspect that interference is taking place.•Follow the manufacturer directions for the implanted medical device.If you have any questions about using your wireless device with an implanted medical device, consult your health care provider.Hearing Warning: When you use the headset, your ability to hear outside sounds may be affected. Do not use the headset where it can endanger your safety.Some wireless devices may interfere with some hearing aids.NickelThe surface of this device is nickel-free.VehiclesRadio signals may affect improperly installed or inadequately shielded electronic systems in vehicles. For more info, check with the manufacturer of your vehicle or its equipment.Only authorized personnel should install the device in a vehicle. Faulty installation may be dangerous and invalidate your warranty. Check regularly that all wireless device equipment in your vehicle is mounted and operating properly. Do not store or carry flammable or explosive materials in the same compartment as the device, its parts, or accessories. Do not place your device or accessories in the air bag deployment area.Potentially explosive environmentsSwitch your device off in potentially explosive environments, such as near gas pumps.

Check with the manufacturers of vehicles using liquefied petroleum gas (such as propane or butane) if this device can be safely used in their vicinity.Certification information (SAR)This mobile device meets guidelines for exposure to radio waves as set forth by the Council of Europe (CE). Refer to the following.European RF Exposure InformationYour mobile device is a radio transmitter and receiver. It is designed not to exceed the limits for exposure to radio waves recommended by international guidelines. These guidelines were developed by the independent scientific organization ICNIRP and include safety margins designed to assure the protection of all persons, regardless of age and health. The guidelines use a unit of measurement known as the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR. The SAR limit for mobile devices is 2.0 W/kg and the highest SAR value for this device when tested at the ear is 0.751 W/kg*. As mobile devices offer a range of functions, they can be used in other positions, such as on the body. In this case, the highest tested SAR value is 1.202 W/kg* at the separation distance of 0.5 cm from the body. For electronic safety, maintain the separation distance with accessories containing no metal, that position handset a minimum of the above distance. Use of other accessories may not ensure compliance with RF exposure guidelines.* The tests are carried out in accordance with international guidelines for testing.About Digital Rights ManagementWhen using this device, obey all laws and respect local customs, privacy and legitimate rights of others, including copyrights.

       "\" The instructions provided seem to be for a Nokia 6310 phone. Here's how to insert a SIM card into it:\\n\\n1. Put your fingernail in the small slot at the top of the phone, lift and remove the cover.\\n2. If the battery is in the phone, to remove it, lift it out.\\n3. Slide the SIM card in the SIM card slot with the contact area face down. If you have a second SIM, slide it in the SIM2 slot. Both SIM cards are available at the same time when the device is not being used, but while one SIM card is active, for example, making a call, the other may be unavailable.\\n4. If you have a memory card, slide the memory card holder to the left and open it up. Place the memory card in the slot.\""
